 Question 2: This time the challenge is to create an array of strings, then write some code that prints the number of items in the array and also the number of unique items in the array.

I’ll provide some hints below, but please take the time to think about a solution before you read them. Trust me: forgetting what you’ve learned then re-learning it actually makes it sink in deeper!



MY ANSWER: let arr = ["Sajan", "Mahla", "Harsimranjeet", "Sam", "Sajan"]
let unique = Set(arr)
print("Total: \(arr.count), Unique: \(unique.count)")
