Question 8: Your challenge is this: make a protocol that describes a building, adding various properties and methods, then create two structs, House and Office, that conform to it. Your protocol should require the following:

A property storing how many rooms it has.
A property storing the cost as an integer (e.g. 500,000 for a building costing $500,000.)
A property storing the name of the estate agent responsible for selling the building.
A method for printing the sales summary of the building, describing what it is along with its other properties.

My Answer: extension Building {
    func buildingDescription() -> String {
        return "\(rooms) rooms â€“ $\(buildingCost), sold by \(agent)"
    }
}

struct House: Building { var rooms: Int; var buildingCost: Int; var agent: String }
struct Office: Building { var rooms: Int; var buildingCost: Int; var agent: String }

let house = House(rooms: 5, buildingCost: 50000, agent: "SAM'S BUILDER")
print(house)
let off = Office(rooms: 18, buildingCost: 1000000, agent: "Builder BAYS")
print(off)
