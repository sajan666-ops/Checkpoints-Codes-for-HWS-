Question 5: You’ve already met sorted(), filter(), map(), so I’d like you to put them together in a chain – call one, then the other, then the other back to back without using temporary variables.

Your input is this:

let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]
Your job is to:

Filter out any numbers that are even
Sort the array in ascending order
Map them to strings in the format “7 is a lucky number”
Print the resulting array, one item per line


My Answer: let luckyNumbers = [7, 4, 38, 21, 16, 15, 12, 33, 31, 49]
let result = luckyNumbers.filter { $0 % 2 != 0 }.sorted().map { "\($0) is a lucky number" }
result.forEach { print($0) }
